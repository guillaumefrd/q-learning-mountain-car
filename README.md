# Q-Learning

Implementation of the reinforcement learning algorithm Q-Learning.

### Environment

We use the OpenAI Gym environment [MountainCar-v0](https://gym.openai.com/envs/MountainCar-v0/). 

The latter has a continuous state space of 2 features which are the car *position* and *velocity*.

Its action space is discrete and is composed of 3 actions: *"push left", "no push", "push right"*.

### Results

Watch our [video](https://youtu.be/e3UvBDGH5GI) to see the results of the experiment on 5000 episodes.
